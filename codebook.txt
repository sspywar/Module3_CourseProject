# Codebook
This is the codebook that describes the tidy data set output for Coursera Data Science course Module Getting and Cleaning Data course project

This tidy data set is the resultant data set obtained from the data linked to the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The tidy data gives the average values of a selection of variables, the features with mean() and std(), for each activity and each subject.

## Variables
The variables of the tidy data set is given below:

* subject
The ID of the test subject. Range from 1:30

* activity_label
The activity carried out by the subject. Range (LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS)

* feature measurements
The average values of the feature measurements for each activity and each subject. The features selected are the mean and standard deviation of the measurements, ending with mean() or std(). The list of features are as below:
